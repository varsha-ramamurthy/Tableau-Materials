# NYC Citibike Data 2019

## Objective

### To analyze data from Citibike and visualize the following relationships
-  i. Trip Duration and Gender

-  ii. Trip Duration and Age
  
> To answer the question of the most popular start and end points in the Citibike map

> To use Tableau to visualize the results of these relationships and the answer to our question

## Methods

- In order to visualize the relationship between trip duration and gender, a bar graph and a circle graph were made to depict aggregates of
the trip duration by gender. Both visualizations yielded the same result

- Line graphs were used to factor in age when examining the relationships between age and trip duration

- A map was used to depict different Citibike locations from which people started and ended their journey. Each plot point on the map was
used to depict the popularity of a station as a start/end point

- Dashboards were created to group together the visualizations depicting the same relationships

- A story was created to summarize the results

## Results

- Gender 1 had the greatest trip duration aggregate from the bar and circle visualizations

- Those born in 1969 showed the greatest trip duration aggregate according to the line graph

- Citibike station 3186 doubled as the most popular start and end point, but had more people using it as an endpoint, meaning that it is a more
popular end point than it is a starting point
